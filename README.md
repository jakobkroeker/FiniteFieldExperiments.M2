### FiniteFieldExperiments.M2

A Macaulay2-Framework for finite field experiments for explicit and implicitly given ideals and parameter spaces
( FiniteFieldExperiments.m2), in preliminary alpha version.


The package provides also lifting of (polynomial) system solutions over a prime field to an extension field of rationals
( padicLift.m2 )


To use the packages,
an installed M2 (available at http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/Downloads/), =>v1.5 ) is mandatory
and they need to be installed first:

- run
 
```
make install
```


Then look at the examples in the *experiments*-folder
or for help . e.g. by 
`viewHelp FiniteFieldExperiments`
